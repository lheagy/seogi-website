My research uses computational methods in geophysical inversion and data science to advance the use of applied geophysics in geoscience applications including groundwater, environmental, geotechnical, and minerals. Problems in these applications are multi-disciplinary requiring effective mechanisms such as open-source tools to communicate across disciplinary lines. Such tools are important to me, as I want to interact with people from both academia and industry to help solve these problems. I bring computational expertise as well as experience related to field acquisition particularly in electromagnetics (EM) and induced polarization (IP), but also I have a background in potential field methods such as gravity and magnetics. I am a developer of open-source computational tools (e.g. SimPEG â€” open-source geophysical software) and want to promote the growth of those open source tools as well as use them.

I am a co-creator of Python-based open-source geophysical simulation and inversion package, SimPEG, and an editor of on-line text books for EM and applied geophysics: EM GeoSCi and GPG, respectively.

## SimPEG (www.simpeg.xyz)

SimPEG includes a suite of geophysical methods including magnetics, gravity, ERT (or DC resistivity), EM, magnetotellurics (MT).

## EM GeoSci (em.geosci.xyz)

On-line text book for electromagnetic geophysics.

## Geophysics for Practicing Geophysicists (gpg.geosci.xyz)

On-line text book for applied geophysics.
